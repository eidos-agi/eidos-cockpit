# Decision: Founding Agreement — Eidos AGI

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Pilots:** Daniel, Vybhav
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Boone Voyage and Rhea are both dead. The product, team, and infrastructure survive. The company plan (`briefs/2026-02-28-company-plan.md`) identified three blocking decisions: company name, equity split, and initial capital.

All three were resolved in a single conversation between Daniel Shanklin and Vybhav Reddy KC on February 28, 2026.

## Decisions

### 1. Eidos exists as a company
Start now. Servers, code, email — the full stack. Structure first, even before revenue.

### 2. Equity: 50/50
Daniel Shanklin and Vybhav Reddy KC split ownership equally.

### 3. Initial capital
Daniel seeds the funds required for servers, email, domain, and incorporation.

## What Was Said

> **Daniel:** I propose we start Eidos as a company, servers, code, and we go 50/50
>
> **Vybhav:** Sure Daniel
>
> **Daniel:** cool, scaffolding now.

## Consequences

- Incorporation can proceed (entity type TBD — C-Corp or LLC)
- Domain registration (`eidosagi.com`) unblocked
- Server unsuspension unblocked
- Email setup unblocked
- IP assignment: all existing code in `eidos-agi` org assigns to the new entity
- Both founders are builders with equal stake — no passive equity

## Still Open

| Decision | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Entity type | Delaware C-Corp (if fundraising) or LLC (if bootstrapping). Can start as LLC and convert later. |
| Company legal name | "Eidos AGI, LLC" / "Eidos AGI, Inc." — or something else entirely |
| Vesting schedule | Standard 4-year with 1-year cliff, or immediate? Should be discussed. |
| Operating agreement / bylaws | Needed after entity type is chosen |
