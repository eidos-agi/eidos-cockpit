## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
CLAUDE.md references three domain skills that don't exist yet:

- `/plan-sprint` — Review backlog, prioritize, assign work across pilots
- `/vision-check` — Re-read product philosophy, check alignment of current work
- `/research-brief` — Summarize research findings for a topic into a decision-ready brief

These need to be created as skill files in `.claude/skills/` following the cockpit template pattern.
