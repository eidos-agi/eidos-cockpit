## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Four research agents produced detailed findings during the Feb 26 session:

1. **Memory compression state-of-the-art** — MemGPT/Letta, Claude Code compression, LangChain/LlamaIndex, sliding window patterns
2. **Eidos codebase memory audit** — existing PEFM system, distillation, session tracking, gaps
3. **Agent auth landscape** — IETF drafts, SPIFFE, competitive landscape (Descope, Token Security, SGNL), Hancock market gap
4. **Agent-as-employee landscape** — Devin, Manus, Dust.tt, communication stack, legal framework, RBAC, proactive patterns

These findings are captured in eidos-v5 backlog task notes but should be distilled into readable briefs in `eidos-cockpit/briefs/` so any pilot (especially Vybhav) can get up to speed quickly.
