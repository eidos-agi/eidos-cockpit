## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up an eidos-agi team on Railway for shared deployment access. Currently Railway is under Daniel's personal account. The Hancock frontend prototype (and future Eidos services) need a shared team so both pilots can deploy and manage services.

Includes: create team, invite Vybhav, migrate or create project for Hancock dashboard deployment.
