title: "Universal Agent (North Star)"
---

## Description

The core vision: Eidos as a full agent that works with ANY website, ANY terminal, ANY interface via screen-and-keyboard control. APIs are optimizations; screen control is the universal fallback.

Key deliverables:
- Computer Use / CUA integration as primary interaction mode
- Agent identity (email, phone, Slack, persistent presence)
- Memory compression and sliding context window (TASK-28)
- The onboarding test: Eidos onboards itself at a fake company

This is the North Star. Everything else feeds into this.
