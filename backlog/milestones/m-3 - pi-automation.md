## Description

Program Increment: Investment Research Pipeline — the first vertical proof that Eidos can do real analytical work. Covers validation runs (PANW, CRWD), orchestrator integration, dashboard scorecard, watchlist mode, score drift detection, and scheduled re-analysis.

Tasks: TASK-22 through TASK-27. Depends on PI-1 through PI-8 validation (archived).

This milestone doubles as a proof-of-concept for the North Star vision: if Eidos can autonomously run investment research at analyst quality, it can do anything.
